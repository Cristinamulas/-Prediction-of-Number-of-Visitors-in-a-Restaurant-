# Prediction-of-Number-of-Visitors-in-a-Restaurant

I've built a model using time series to predict the number of visitors to a restaurant per day. The data contains two features and 3,651 entries. I used Arima model to predict future outcomes of the number of clients in a restaurant. I also implemented time series using Prophet, a great package made by Facebook. With this package, I could implement a more detailed and robust analysis.
