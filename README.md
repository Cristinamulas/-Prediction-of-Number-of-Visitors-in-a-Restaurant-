# Prediction-of-Number-of-Visitors-in-a-Restaurant

I build a model using time series to predict the number of visitors in a restauran per day. The data contains two features and 3651 entries entries. I used Arima model to predict future outcomes of the number of clients in a restaurant. I also implement time series using a packed made by Facebook called Prophet. With this packed, I could implement a more detailed analysis.
